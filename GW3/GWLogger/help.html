        <h1>Welcome to the CAESAR</h1>
        <h2>Why CAESAR?</h2>
        CAESAR stands for <b>CA</b> <b>E</b>PICS <b>S</b>py <b>A</b>nd <b>R</b>eport.
        <h2>How to use it:</h2>
        On top most of the interface some tabs are available (Status, Logs, Help). By clicking on them the interface switch in the different modes.

        <h3>Status</h3>
        The status page allows to get an overview in near real time (updates every 2 seconds) of all the EPICS gateways.
        Each gateway is displayed with a gray circle and some values in the middle, as well as the gateway name under the circle.
        Over the gray circle 2 arcs may appear of different colors. The most external one shows the CPU in percent form, while
        the inner arc one shows number of searches per seconds the gateway receives (up to 100).<br />

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><canvas id='canvas_all_fine' width='100' height='100'></canvas></td>
                <td>A display like this shows that everything is within the nominal range.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><canvas id='canvas_high_search' width='100' height='100'></canvas></td>
                <td>
                    A display like this shows an high number of searches, but the gateway is not in error as it takes 2 minutes of high number
                    of searches before the gateway is considered in error.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><canvas id='canvas_high_cpu' width='100' height='100'></canvas></td>
                <td>
                    A display like this shows an high CPU usage, but the gateway is not in error as it takes 2 minutes of high CPU load
                    before the gateway is considered in error.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><canvas id='canvas_error' width='100' height='100'></canvas></td>
                <td>A display like this shows an high CPU usage and the gateway in error (see the red background in the middle).</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <br />
        By clicking on the gateway, more details of the gateway will be displayed. On this page it's possible (for the authorized people) to restart
        the gateway or upgrade the gateway to the latest build. The "Logs" button will switch to the "Logs" view and the "Check Configuration" will open
        the inventory website showing the Gateway configuration.
        <h3>Errors</h3>
        On the right most of the interface a column contains either a green button with the text "No errors" or one or more red buttons.
        In case a red button replaces the green one, the red button text will be the gateway which is currently on an error state.
        It's possible to click on the red button to directly jump on the live details view of that particular gateway.
        <h3>Logs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Select the gateway you want to check on the top left side. The gateway sessions are then loaded and displayed on the left bar,
                as well as the statistics are displayed on the time range widget.
            </li>
            <li>You can click (and drag) the time range widget to check out more details on that time.</li>
            <li>
                The time range shows 3 values: top light green bars are the number of event logs, bottom dark green bars are the number of searches,
                red lines are the number of errors. The graphs uses 3 different scales.
            </li>
            <li>Logs uses UTC time (avoiding issue with day light saving time).</li>
            <li>The current UTC time is displayed on the bottom left corner of the screen.</li>
            <li>Each bar of the time range is a 10 min range.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Map</h2>
        The map view allows to have an overview of all the gateways used at PSI and their current status. This view allows also to see which gateway
        will be used while crossing multiple networks.
        <h2>Queries:</h2>
        <div id="queriesHelp"></div>
        <h2>Advanced queries:</h2>
        CAESAR allows more complex queries via the following syntax:<br />
        SELECT [fields] GROUP BY [fields] ORDER BY [fields] [ASC/DESC] LIMIT [number or rows]<br />
        The selection of the fields can contains the following grouping functions:
        <ul>
            <li>Min([field])</li>
            <li>Max([field])</li>
            <li>Count(*)</li>
            <li>Avg([field])</li>
        </ul>
        Example:<br />
        select channel,count(*) nb,sum(packetsize) group by channel order by nb desc limit 5
        <h2>EPICS Debug tool:</h2>
        By clicking on the hamburger menu (on the top left) and then on the entry "EPICS Debug" it is possible to try to debug if
        there is an error with a gateway or if the gateway seems to react in an abnormal way.<br />
        <br />
        To use the tool, an EPICS channel name must be given and a gateway selected. Once this is done, by pressing the button "Run test"
        a couple of tests will be run on the gateway machine. At the end of the tests, a summary displays what seems to be the state of the gateway.<br />
        <br />
        In case of error as status, it's advice to re-run the test, and only then if the error persist contact the support.
        <h2>Check Wrong Channels</h2>
        By clicking on the hamburger menu (on the top left) and then on the entry "Check Wrong Channels" it is possible to check which
        channels has been searched on a given gateway and didn't returned any result. The result is grouped by client hostname where the top most
        demanding client is shown on top. To expand a group you have to click on the triangle which will then show all the channels requested by that
        particular client.
        <h2>Web Notifications</h2>
        It is possible to let the web application emit a sound and a notification in case of error. To enable it, use the hamburger menu
        (on the top left) and then the "Enable Notifications".
        <h2>Alert Subscription</h2>
        The site allows to subscribe to alerts. To enable it, use the hamburder menu (on the top left) and then the "Alert Subscription" page.
        Choose all the gateways you are interested in, and press the "Save" button at the bottom.
        <h2>Data retention:</h2>
        Data is kept for a max. time of 5 days.
        <h1>How to debug EPICS</h1>
        Due to the distributed nature of EPICS, the problem can be on one or more of the following point:
        <ul>
            <li>EPICS Client configuration (environement variables)</li>
            <li>Client side (Eg. caQtDM)</li>
            <li>EPICS Gateway</li>
            <li>EPICS Server (Eg. IOC)</li>
        </ul>
        In some case a single request will need to pass multiple gateways, and therefore makes the debugging yet even more complex.<br />
        <br />
        Therefore to debug an EPICS issue follow the following checklist:
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure the environement variables are set correctly (Eg. cam / cao / cahipa etc.)</li>
            <li>Make sure the channel you want to connect to really exists (check it on the same network as the IOC)</li>
            <li>Make sure the channel is not blocked by the gateway due to some naming issue.</li>
            <li>Use the Debug tool included in this web site.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are using a gateway to reach that channel (if the IOC runs on the same network as you are, then no gateways are involved)</li>
            <li>If it still doesn't work report the issue specifying which channel doesn't work, on which network you are and on which network the IOC running the channel is.</li>
        </ul>
